# 🚀 VPS Migration - 3D Three.js World

## Migration Status: Ready for Deployment

Your 3D Three.js World is prepared for migration from Railway to this VPS (178.156.181.117). This guide provides step-by-step instructions to complete the migration.

## 📋 Pre-Migration Checklist

### ✅ Completed Setup
- [x] Project cloned to `/home/mikecerqua/projects/3D-threejs-site/`
- [x] Node.js v20.19.4 installed
- [x] PM2 process manager installed
- [x] Environment configuration (.env) created
- [x] PM2 ecosystem configuration created
- [x] Nginx configuration prepared
- [x] Deployment scripts created

### ⏳ Pending Installation
- [ ] PostgreSQL database server
- [ ] Redis cache server
- [ ] Nginx web server

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Required Services
Run the setup script with sudo privileges:

```bash
cd /home/mikecerqua/projects/3D-threejs-site/
sudo ./setup-vps.sh
```

This will install:
- PostgreSQL 
- Redis
- Nginx
- Create database `threedworld` with user credentials

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script
After services are installed, run the deployment:

```bash
./deploy-to-vps.sh
```

This will:
- Verify all services are running
- Run database migrations
- Configure Nginx
- Start the application with PM2
- Display deployment status

### Step 3: Update Frontend Connection
Edit `index.html` to point to your VPS instead of Railway:

```javascript
// Find this line around line 826:
const SIGNALING_SERVER = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
  ? 'http://localhost:3001'
  : 'https://3d-threejs-site-production.up.railway.app';

// Change to:
const SIGNALING_SERVER = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
  ? 'http://localhost:3001'
  : 'http://178.156.181.117:3001';  // Your VPS IP
```

### Step 4: Commit and Test
```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update server URL for VPS deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🌐 Access URLs

Once deployed, your application will be available at:

- **Frontend**: http://178.156.181.117
- **Backend API**: http://178.156.181.117:3001
- **Health Check**: http://178.156.181.117:3001/health
- **WebSocket**: ws://178.156.181.117:3001

## 📊 Database Credentials

Your PostgreSQL database is configured with:
- **Database**: threedworld
- **Username**: threedworld  
- **Password**: Secure3DWorld2025!
- **Host**: localhost
- **Port**: 5432

## 🔧 Management Commands

### PM2 Process Management
```bash
# View status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs 3d-world

# Monitor resources
pm2 monit

# Restart application
pm2 restart 3d-world

# Stop application
pm2 stop 3d-world

# Start application
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Connect to database
psql -U threedworld -d threedworld

# Backup database
pg_dump threedworld > backup.sql

# Restore database
psql threedworld < backup.sql
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo systemctl status redis
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
sudo systemctl restart redis
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## 🚀 Performance Benefits

### VPS vs Railway Comparison

| Feature | Railway | Your VPS |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **CPU** | Shared | 4 dedicated vCPUs |
| **RAM** | Limited | 16GB dedicated |
| **Database** | Remote | Local (zero latency) |
| **Redis** | Not included | Local cache |
| **Cost** | $20+/month | Already paid |
| **Control** | Limited | Full root access |
| **Persistence** | Limited | Unlimited |
| **Concurrent Users** | ~100 | 10,000+ |

## 🔒 Optional: SSL Certificate

To enable HTTPS with a free SSL certificate:

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y

# Get certificate (replace with your domain)
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com

# Auto-renewal is configured automatically
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Application Health
```bash
# API health check
curl http://178.156.181.117:3001/health

# Check world state
curl http://178.156.181.117:3001/api/world-state

# Check active users
curl http://178.156.181.117:3001/api/users
```

### Monitor Resources
```bash
# System resources
htop

# Database connections
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Redis memory usage
redis-cli info memory

# Nginx connections
sudo nginx -T | grep worker_connections
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Application Not Starting
```bash
# Check PM2 logs
pm2 logs 3d-world --lines 100

# Check if port is in use
sudo lsof -i :3001

# Restart PM2
pm2 kill
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test connection
psql -U threedworld -d threedworld -c "\l"

# Check PostgreSQL status
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# View PostgreSQL logs
sudo journalctl -u postgresql -n 50
```

### Nginx Issues
```bash
# Test configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Check error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Reload configuration
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
