# CRITICAL: Screen Sharing Was Working - Same Setup

## Important Facts from User

### What WAS Working (Confirmed by User)
- **Multiple browsers**: Worked across different browsers
- **Multiple users**: User and others in the room successfully shared screens
- **Same network**: No network changes since it was working
- **Same computers**: Same devices and setup
- **Production deployment**: Working at commit `3774a49` (August 5, 2025)

### What Has NOT Changed (User Confirmed)
- ❌ **Network**: Same network configuration as when working
- ❌ **Firewall**: No firewall changes
- ❌ **Browsers**: Same browsers that worked before  
- ❌ **ISP**: Same internet service provider
- ❌ **Router**: Same router and settings
- ❌ **Devices**: Same computers/devices
- ❌ **Location**: Same physical location

### What HAS Changed
✅ **Only code changes made during troubleshooting attempts**

## Timeline of Breaking Changes

### Original Working State
- Commit `01b5adf` - Screen sharing worked perfectly
- Simple SimplePeer setup with `trickle: false`
- No ICE server configuration
- Used `addStream()` for existing peers

### When It Broke
1. **Visitor Counter Added** (commit `88830ef`) - Still working
2. **Visitor Counter Disabled** (commit `c90f43d`) - Server started crashing
3. **Various "fixes" applied** - Screen sharing broke

## Critical Analysis

Since the user confirms:
- Same network/firewall/browsers that worked before
- Multiple users successfully used screen sharing
- Nothing changed on user's infrastructure

**The breaking change MUST be in the code modifications**, not infrastructure.

## Potential Code Issues Introduced

### 1. Socket ID Management
During troubleshooting, we changed:
- How reconnections are handled
- When peers are destroyed
- How socket IDs are managed

### 2. Peer Connection Lifecycle  
We modified:
- Always destroying and recreating peers for screen share
- Removed `addStream()` usage
- Changed connection initialization

### 3. Configuration Changes
We tried multiple times:
- Added/removed STUN servers
- Toggled trickle ICE
- Changed offer/answer options

### 4. Event Handling
We added:
- `request-screen-stream` event (new)
- Modified disconnect handling
- Added ping/pong keepalive

## Most Likely Culprit

The issue is probably one of these changes:
1. **Always destroying peers on screen share** - May be breaking existing connections
2. **Socket reconnection handling** - May be confusing peer states
3. **Request-screen-stream logic** - May be creating duplicate or conflicting connections
4. **STUN server configuration** - Current config may not match what was working

## What Was ACTUALLY Working

Looking at commit `01b5adf` (before visitor counter):
```javascript
// Simple configuration that WORKED
const peer = new SimplePeer({
  initiator: initiator,
  trickle: false,
  stream: currentStream || undefined
});

// Used addStream for existing peers
if (peers[userId]) {
  peers[userId].addStream(stream);
}
```

## Current State (BROKEN)

After our changes:
```javascript
// Always destroy and recreate (MIGHT BE THE ISSUE)
if (peers[userId]) {
  peers[userId].destroy();
  delete peers[userId];
}

// Added STUN server (WASN'T IN WORKING VERSION)
config: {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }
  ]
}

// Added request-screen-stream event (NEW LOGIC)
socket.emit('request-screen-stream', { to: data.userId });
```

## Recommended Action

**FULL REVERT TO WORKING STATE**:
1. Git checkout to commit `01b5adf` (last known working)
2. Only apply the visitor counter disable (carefully)
3. Do NOT apply any of the "improvements" we tried
4. Test if screen sharing works again

## Conclusion

The user is correct - if the same setup that worked before isn't working now, and only code changed, then **our "fixes" broke it**. The issue is NOT infrastructure but rather something we changed while troubleshooting.

The most suspicious changes:
1. Always destroying/recreating peer connections
2. The new request-screen-stream event logic  
3. Added STUN server configuration
4. Socket disconnect/reconnect handling

We should revert to the exact working code and be more careful with changes.
