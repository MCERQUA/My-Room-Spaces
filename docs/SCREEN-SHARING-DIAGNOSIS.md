# Screen Sharing Diagnosis Report

## Current Status
**Screen sharing is BROKEN** - ICE negotiation fails preventing P2P video connection

## What IS Working
✅ Socket.IO connection to Railway server is stable  
✅ Screen sharing coordination through server works  
✅ WebRTC offer/answer exchange completes successfully  
✅ Media stream IS received by remote peer  
✅ Request-screen-stream logic for late joiners works  
✅ Peer connections are created correctly  

## What is NOT Working
❌ ICE negotiation fails (checking → disconnected → failed)  
❌ No actual video data flows despite stream being received  
❌ Video shows as 2x2 pixels (metadata only, no content)  

## Pattern Analysis
Every single test shows the EXACT same pattern:
1. Stream object received successfully with correct ID
2. Video track present and enabled
3. ICE state: `checking` → `disconnected` → `failed`
4. Connection state: `connecting` → `failed`
5. Video element receives metadata (2x2 pixels) but no actual video

## Code State
- Code is IDENTICAL to last known working version (commit `01b5adf`)
- SimplePeer configuration matches exactly
- All signaling logic is correct
- Socket connection is stable (no more disconnections)

## Root Cause Analysis

### This is NOT a code issue because:
1. The exact same code worked before
2. Stream metadata IS being transmitted
3. WebRTC handshake completes successfully
4. The failure is specifically at ICE negotiation

### Most Likely Causes:
1. **Network/Firewall Changes**
   - Corporate firewall blocking UDP
   - Symmetric NAT preventing direct connections
   - ISP-level WebRTC blocking

2. **Browser Security Updates**
   - Chrome/Edge WebRTC policy changes
   - Stricter ICE candidate filtering
   - CORS or security policy updates

3. **Railway Infrastructure**
   - Possible changes in Railway's networking
   - WebSocket proxy configuration
   - Different server region/IP

## What We've Tried (All Failed)
1. ✅ Fixed late-joiner connection logic
2. ✅ Stabilized socket connections
3. ❌ Removed all ICE servers (like working version)
4. ❌ Added STUN servers
5. ❌ Added TURN relay servers
6. ❌ Enabled trickle ICE
7. ❌ Disabled trickle ICE
8. ❌ Always recreate connections for screen share
9. ❌ Minimal STUN with trickle disabled

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Test Network Conditions
- Test between two devices on SAME network (eliminates NAT)
- Test with mobile hotspot (different network path)
- Test with VPN disabled (if using one)

### 2. Browser Testing
- Test in Firefox (different WebRTC implementation)
- Test in older Chrome version
- Check chrome://webrtc-internals during connection

### 3. Simple WebRTC Test
Create a minimal test page with just SimplePeer to isolate the issue:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/simple-peer@9/simplepeer.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="testConnection()">Test P2P</button>
  <script>
    function testConnection() {
      const peer = new SimplePeer({
        initiator: true,
        trickle: false
      });
      peer.on('signal', data => console.log('Signal:', data));
      peer.on('connect', () => console.log('Connected!'));
      peer.on('error', err => console.log('Error:', err));
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. Alternative Solutions
If P2P cannot be fixed:
- **WebSocket Relay**: Stream video through Railway server (bandwidth intensive)
- **Media Server**: Use a TURN server or media relay service
- **Different Library**: Try PeerJS or native WebRTC API
- **Paid TURN**: Use Twilio or Xirsys TURN servers

## Historical Context
- **Last Working**: Commit `3774a49` (August 5, 2025) per user report
- **Broke After**: Disabling visitor counter functionality
- **Not Actually Caused By**: The visitor counter changes (code is identical)

## Conclusion
This is a **network/infrastructure issue**, not a code bug. The P2P connection fails at the ICE level despite correct implementation. Either network conditions have changed, browser security has tightened, or the infrastructure has shifted since it last worked.

The fact that the stream object is received but ICE fails is the classic symptom of firewall/NAT blocking.
